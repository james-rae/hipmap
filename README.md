It's a map with locations referenced in Tragically Hip songs.

Just put on a server and browse to `hipmap.html`. Magic.

Or have a look at it hosted on [github](http://james-rae.github.io/hipmap/hipmap.html).

The code is nothing fancy, but you can see how to rock a [FeatureLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jsapi/featurelayer-amd.html) without having an ArcGIS Server hosting your data.  There was plans to add more stuff like a specific image for each point and links to interesting things, but I don't see that happening.

The `gulp` / `node package` stuff is just for me spinning up a little testing web server.

The site will probably look like garbage on most small or mobile screens.

I'm not supporting IE on purpose.
